\begin{abstract} % about 200-400 words
Abstract should be between 200--400 words and should state briefly the purpose
of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is
often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone.
For this reason, references should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the
author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be
avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the
abstract itself.
\end{abstract}

% Provide 2-4 keywords describing your research. Only abbreviations firmly
% established in the field may be used. These keywords will be used for
% sessioning/indexing purposes. Use \sep between each keyword.

\section{Introduction}

After presenting at the 14th U.S. National Combustion Meeting you might choose to submit your work for publication in the {\em Proceedings of the Combustion Institute}. 
To make that process easier, we recommend anticipating the requirements of that publication. Refer to a recent issue for style, content, and formatting. 
Although these guidelines will not be enforced for the current submission, it will save you time later if you comply with them from the beginning: 
Figures and tables should ideally fit in a single column, which is 2.67 in (67.7 mm).  
Double-column figures and tables should be sized for legibility and must fit within a width of 5.67 in (144 mm). 

This \LaTeX\ template is set up to be used with the {\tt biber} bibliography back-end and {\tt biblatex} package instead of {\tt bibtex} and {\tt natbib}.
With it you can use the following cite commands:

Single reference with number only: \cite{Zhao2013}

Multiple references with number only: \cite{Affleck1967,Turanyi2014,cantera}

Single reference with two or fewer authors: \textcite{Affleck1967}

Single reference with three or more authors: \textcite{Wang2011}

Two references with authors: \textcite{Kee1996,Baumgardner2013}

Three or more references with authors: \textcite{Kee1996,Baumgardner2013,Haworth2011}

However, the \LaTeX\ template for submission to the 40th {\em Proceedings of the Combustion Institute} used {\tt bibtex} and {\tt natbib}, so your subsequent submission to the next {\em Proceedings} might be most straightforward if you stick to simple \verb|\cite{}| commands. Then you should have no problems moving your manuscript across.
