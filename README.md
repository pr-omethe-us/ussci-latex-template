# 2019 US National Combustion Meeting LaTeX Template

This repository contains the (unofficial) LaTeX template for the
United States Sections of the Combustion Institute. It has been
tested with TeXLive 2015 and is expected to work with any newer
versions of TeXLive and MikTeX.

## Instructions

1. Download a zip file of this repository and extract it
2. Open and try to build the `template.tex` file to make sure that everything works properly
3. If your references don't end up as numbers, make sure that your TeX environment/editor is set to use biber to compile the references. By default, most editors (such as TeXStudio) default to using BibTeX.
4. Copy the `template.tex` file and edit it to add your paper content

## Dependencies

The template uses the following
packages that must be installed with their dependencies:

* biblatex
* biber
* calc
* fontenc
* inputenc
* mathptmx
* titlesec
* authblk
* hyperref
* geometry
* fancyhdr
